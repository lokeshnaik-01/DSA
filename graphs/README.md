# Graph Concepts
## Bi Partite Graph
- A bipartite graph is a graph in which the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent. In other words, it is a graph in which every edge connects a vertex of one set to a vertex of the other set.

- graphs with even cycle length can be bipartite 
- graphs with odd cycle length can never be bipartite
